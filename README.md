## Overview
FunkoLens is an Angular-based Progressive Web App (PWA) that enables users to analyze recent completed eBay marketplace sales of Funko collectibles and manage a personal collection based on real transaction data.

The application allows authenticated users to search for specific items, review recent sales, and view pricing statistics such as averages, medians, and trimmed means. Based on configurable costs and fees, FunkoLens provides realistic profit and loss estimates for individual items as well ass aggregated value insights for an entire collection.

By focusing on completed sales rather than active listings, FunkoLens aims to deliver transparent, data-driven insights that support informed buying, selling and long-term value tracking decisions.
